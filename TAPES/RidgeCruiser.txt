 Ridge Cruiser for C1P
© Stankiewicz & Robinson, Victory Software

You are in a space ship flying down the trench shooting invaders.
You have limited movement to avoid your enemies, fly too far to 
the sides and you'll hit the trench walls!  Destroy the incoming ships,
the further out, the higher the score.  Hit the tranports flying by for
higher points!

This is a hybrid program that was reconstructed from a PicoDos disk
It loads in two parts, the machine language portion stored in BASIC
data statements, and the main program which loads later.

RidgeCruiser.bas contains both parts in one file

Controls are: 

Turrent control U = Up        Y = Up Left
                M = Down      N = Down Left
                H = Left      I = Up Right
                K = Right     , = Down Right
                J = Fire
